Lesson 1: While solving the "find two numbers that add up to two numbers problem", there is a clever optimization for a
one pass solution. What this means is, if there is a data processing/transformation step and a subsequent step for finding
the solution and that solution also involves traversing the array, see if you can do it in one pass!
