1. Be comfortable with bitwise operations. Particularly XOR.
2. Understand how masks work. Use them in machine independent ways.
3. Clear/set/get index of the lowermost bit set.
4. Understand signedness and implications of shifting.
5. Use a cache where applicable.
6. Commutativity and associativity can be used to perform operations in parallel and reorder operations.
